# _algobase_: Algorithms and data structures templates
This is a repository with implementations of many algorithms and data structures in C++.
It was written for using in competitive programming as templates to save time and do not get distracted by writing a theoretical algorithms.

# List of contents
Repository includes C++ files which contains implementation of following algorithms and data structures:

## graphs.cpp
 - *graph* - template for graphs (used below)
 - *multi edges* - function to remove multi edges from graph
 - *topological sort* - toplogical sort of graph or part of it
 - *bridges* - selection of bridges in graph
 - *edge biconnected components* - coloring and condensation of graph by edge biconnected components
 - *strongly connected components* - coloring and condensation of graph by strongly connected components
 - *2-SAT* - structure for solving 2-SAT problem

## strings.cpp
 - *trie* - trie structure for strings
 - *number trie* - trie structure for integers
 - *hash* - structure for polynomial hashing

## trees.cpp
 - *treap* - treap and implicit treap structures
 - *fenwick tree* - Fenwick tree structure and it's version with range operations
 - *2D fenwick tree* - 2-dimensional Fenwick tree structure and it's version with range operations
